# 02_Convolutional_NN â€“ Convolutional Neural Network

## Objective

This stage improves upon the previous by using a CNN, which is better suited for image data.

## Contents

- `Convolutional_NN.ipynb`: Notebook implementing the CNN.
- Data loading with transforms.
- CNN architecture: Conv2d, ReLU, Pooling layers.

## Setup

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

```bash
jupyter notebook Convolutional_NN.ipynb
```

Run all cells to train the CNN and compare to the sequential model.

## Output

- Improved accuracy compared to previous model.
- Training loss and accuracy plots.
