# 01_Secuencial_NN â€“ Sequential Neural Network (Baseline)

## Objective

This stage implements a **basic sequential neural network** as a baseline model. It uses fully-connected layers to classify images and provides a reference point for performance before introducing convolutions.

## Contents

- `Sequential_NN.ipynb`: Notebook implementing the sequential neural network.
- Basic training loop using PyTorch.
- Simple dataset loading and preprocessing.

## Setup

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

```bash
jupyter notebook Sequential_NN.ipynb
```

Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## Output

- Printed loss and accuracy values.
- Simple plots showing training performance.
