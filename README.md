# IPRE-Segmentacion ‚Äì Deep Learning for Image Segmentation

This repository contains the step-by-step development of a deep learning pipeline for image segmentation using PyTorch. The project progresses from a simple neural network to a complete U-Net model, eventually incorporating advanced tools like **PyTorch Lightning** and **Weights & Biases (W&B)**.

## üîç Project Overview

The goal of this project is to segment images (such as rock samples or biomedical data) using deep learning. It begins with basic neural networks and ends with a scalable training system using PyTorch Lightning.

### Project Stages

Each folder corresponds to a stage of development:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `01_Secuencial_NN` | Baseline with fully connected (sequential) neural network |
| `02_Convolutional_NN` | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification |
| `03_Segmentation_NN` | First segmentation model (basic encoder-decoder) |
| `04_UNET_Segmentation` | Implementation of the U-Net architecture |
| `05_UNET_v01` | Modularized U-Net training with scripts |
| `06_UNET_v02` | Improvements in training, splitting, and structure |
| `07_UNET_v03` | Data augmentation and multi-class support |
| `08_UNET_v04` | PyTorch Lightning integration |
| `09_UNET_PREFINAL` | Final model using Lightning + W&B |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To get started, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
pip install pytorch-lightning wandb albumentations jupyter
```

Make sure you log into W&B if using experiment tracking:

```bash
wandb login
```

## üöÄ Running the Models

Navigate to any folder and follow the instructions in its `README.md`.

Example:

```bash
cd 09_UNET_PREFINAL
python train_unet_prefinal.py
```

You can also start from earlier folders if you want to understand how the project evolved.

## üìä Results

By the final stage, the model logs training metrics to **Weights & Biases**, including:

- Training and validation loss
- Dice score / IoU
- Sample predictions
- System usage and hyperparameters

---

## üìÅ Dataset

This project assumes access to a dataset of images and their corresponding segmentation masks. You can adapt the dataset loading logic in each folder to match your data format.

---

## üß† Model

The final model is a U-Net architecture with:

- Convolutional encoder-decoder structure
- Skip connections
- Data augmentation
- PyTorch Lightning training
- W&B logging and early stopping
